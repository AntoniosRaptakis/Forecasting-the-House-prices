# Predicting the price of houses


Buying a house is one of the biggest dreams of any family, or even individuals. It is a "long-time" project and investment, because one pays the loan to the financial institution for several years. People consider that they are paying the rent for the house, but after few years this house belongs to them.
This project aims to predict the price of a house. The dataset has been taken by kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

The region that the data have been collected is Ames at Iowa in the United States of America.

**Goal of the project**: Create a predictive model for the house price.

The libraries that I used:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Plotly

After reading the dataset using pandas, I realized that there are missing values. If we assume the dataframe as a matrix, where the columns are on the horizontal direction and the rows on the vertical, the missing values can be clearly visualized with the yellow lines, as shown in the figure below.
